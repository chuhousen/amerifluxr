# amerifluxr
An R programmatic interface for querying, handling, and summarizing AmeriFlux (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/) data and metadata.  

## Target user
- Advanced users who use data from many AmeriFlux sites
- Users who handle data from multiple sources, e.g., AmeriFlux, PhenoCam, MODIS...

## A tentative workflow (task list)
- [x] List the sites, with basic site general info     
- [x] See if and how much data & metadata are available
  - [x] Flux/met data (BASE) year availability (site-year level)
  - [x] Flux/met data variable availability (variable-year level)
  - [x] Metadata (BIF) availability (variable-group level)
  - [x] Metadata availability (variable level 
- Subset a target site list (no specific func, could be achived using data.table)
- [x] Download data & metadata
  - BASE & BIF downloads are done separately through AmeriFlux UI (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/download-data/)
  - [x] Access measurement height data product through R
- [x] Parse data & metadata
  - [x] BASE: read data files
    - [x] Parse timestamps
    - [x] Parse variable names/qualifiers 
    - [x] Get variable default units
  - [x] BIF: read files
    - [x] Parse variable groups 
    - List target sitesâ€™ contacts & DOI
- [x] Clean & summarize data
  - [x] Clean out-range data in BASE, based on physical range limit
- [ ] Do data visualization & any further processing 
  - [ ] Diurnal-seasonal plot
  - [ ] Variable availability plot
  - Some of this might be done using other packages
    - **REddyProc** handles u*-filtering, gap-filling, partitioning, and certain time-series plots 
    - **FluxnetLSM** converts data into NetCDF, gap-filling
    - **openair** creates windrose, time-series plots
