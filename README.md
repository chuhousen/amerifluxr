An R programmatic interface for querying, downloading, and handling [AmeriFlux](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/) data and metadata.  

## Insallation

### Stable release

Coming up soon!!

### Development release

To install the development releases of the package run the following
commands:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("chuhousen/amerifluxr")
library("amerifluxr")
```

Vignettes are not rendered by default, if you want to include additional

```
## Use

### Obtain an AmeriFlux site list 

This function obtains the latest AmeriFlux site list and
sites' general info through the AmeriFlux web service.

``` r
site <- amf_site_info()

```

### Download all-site metadata

Access to AmeriFlux data requires creating an AmeriFlux account first.
Register an account through the
[link](https://ameriflux-data.lbl.gov/Pages/RequestAccount.aspx).

The following downloads a single file containing all AmeriFlux sites'
metadata (i.e., BADM data product) for sites under the CC-BY-4.0 data 
use policy. The downloaded file is a Excel file saved to tempdir()
(e.g., AMF\_\{SITES\}\_BIF\_\{POLICY\}\_\{VERSION\}\.xlsx, SITES
= AA-Net (all registered sites) or AA-Flx (all sites with flux/met 
data available); POLICY = CCBY4 (shared under AmeriFlux CC-BY-4.0 
data use policy) or LEGACY (shared under AmeriFlux LEGACY data use
policy)). 

For details about BADM data files, see AmeriFlux 
[web page](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/aboutdata/badm-data-product/).


``` r
floc1 <- amf_download_bif(user_id = "my_user",
                          user_email = "my_email@mail.com",
                          data_policy = "CCBY4.0",
                          intended_use = "synthesis",
                          intended_use_text = "obtain AmeriFlux sites' geolocation, IGBP, and climate classification",
                          out_dir = tempdir(),
                          verbose = TRUE,
                          site_w_data = TRUE)
```

| user_id            | AmeriFlux account username                                                                                                      |
| user_email         | AmeriFlux account user email                                                                                                    |
| data_policy        | "CCBY4.0" or "LEGACY". AmeriFlux data are shared under two tiers of licenses as chosen by site's PI.                            |
| intended_use       | The intended use category. It needs to be "synthesis", "model", "remote_sensing","other_research", "education", or "other"      |
| intended_use_text  | Brief description of intended use.This will be recorded in the data download log and emailed to site's PI.                      |
| out_dir            | Output directory for downloaded data, default to tempdir()                                                                      |

The amf_download_bif() returns the full file path to the downloaded file,
which can be used to read the file into R.

``` r
bif <- amf_read_bif(file = floc1)

```

### Download single-site flux/met data

The following downloads AmeriFlux flux/met data (aka BASE data product)
from a single site. For details about BASE data files, see AmeriFlux
[BASE data](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/data-processing-pipelines/base-publish/)
page. 

The downloaded file is a zipped file saved in tempdir()
(e.g., AMF\_\{SITE_ID\}\_BASE-BADM\_\{VERSION\}\.zip), which contains a BASE data 
file (e.g., AMF\_\{SITE_ID\}\_BASE\_\{RESOLUTION\}\_\{VERSION\}\.csv, 
RESOLUTION = HH (half-hourly) or HR (hourly)) and a BADM data file (e.g., 
AMF\_\{SITE_ID\}\_BIF\_\{VERSION\}\.xlsx). The BADM data file is a site subset of 
the all-site BADM downloaded through amf_download_bif().

``` r
floc2 <- amf_download_base(user_id = "my_user",
                           user_email = "my_email@mail.com",
                           site_id = "US-CRT",
                           data_product = "BASE-BADM",
                           data_policy = "CCBY4.0",
                           intended_use = "remote_sensing",
                           intended_use_text = "validate the model of GPP estimation",
                           verbose = TRUE,
                           out_dir = tempdir())

```

| site_id            | A scalar or vector of character specifying the AmeriFlux Site ID (CC-Sss)                                                       |
| data_product       | AmeriFlux data product. Currently, only "BASE-BADM" is currently supported and used as default.                                 |
| data_policy        | "CCBY4.0" or "LEGACY". AmeriFlux data are shared under two tiers of licenses as chosen by site's PI.                            |

| verbose            | Show feedback on download progress                                                                                              |

The amf_download_base() returns the full file path to the downloaded file,
which can be used to read the file into R.

``` r
base <- amf_read_base(file = floc2,
                      unzip = TRUE,
                      parse_timestamp = TRUE)
```


| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                     |

| unzip              | logical, whether to unzip. Set TRUE if reading from a zipped file                                                               |
| parse_timestamp    | logical, whether to parse the timestamp                                                                                         |


### Download multiple-site flux/met data

The following downloads AmeriFlux flux/met data from multiple sites. 
The downloaded files are organized by sites, with one zipped file for
each site, similar to single-site download.

``` r
amf_download_base(user_id = "my_user",
                  user_email = "my_email@mail.com",
                  site_id = c("US-CRT", "US-WPT", "US-Oho"),
                  data_product = "BASE-BADM",
                  data_policy = "CCBY4.0",
                  intended_use = "model",
                  intended_use_text = "Data-driven modeling, for training models and cross-validation",
                  verbose = TRUE,
                  out_dir = tempdir())

```
### Additional functionalities

**Site Selection Vignette** demonstrates examples to query a list
of target sites based on sites' general information and availability
of metadata and data. 

**Data Import Vignette** demonstrates examples to import data and metadata
downloaded from AmeriFlux, and parse and clean data for further use.
