## Use

### Obtain a full list of AmeriFlux sites with general info

This function obtains the latest AmeriFlux site list and
sites' general info through the AmeriFlux web service.

``` r
site <- amf_site_info()

```

### Download all-site metadata

To download all AmeriFlux sites' metadata (i.e., BADM data product)
in a single file, use the following. Note: Access to AmeriFlux data requires
creating an AmeriFlux account first. Register an account through the
[link](https://ameriflux-data.lbl.gov/Pages/RequestAccount.aspx).
For details about BADM data files, see AmeriFlux 
[web page](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/aboutdata/badm-data-product/).
The downloaded file is a Excel file (e.g., AMF_<SITES>_BIF_LEGACY_<VERSION>.xlsx, 
SITES = AA-Net (all registered sites) or AA-Flx (all sites with data available)).

``` r
amf_download_bif(user_id = "my_user",
                 user_email = "my_email@mail.com",
                 data_policy = "CCBY4.0",
                 intended_use = "synthesis",
                 intended_use_text = "obtain AmeriFlux sites' geolocation, IGBP, and climate classification",
                 out_dir = tempdir(),
                 verbose = TRUE,
                 site_w_data = TRUE)
```

### Download single-site flux/met data

The following downloads AmeriFlux flux/met data (aka BASE data product)
from a single site. For details about BASE data files, see AmeriFlux
[BASE data](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/data-processing-pipelines/base-publish/)
page. Note: The downloaded file is a zipped file (e.g., AMF_<SITE_ID>_BASE-BADM_<VERSION>.zip),
which contains a BASE data file (e.g., AMF_<SITE_ID>_BASE_<RESOLUTION>_<VERSION>.csv, 
RESOLUTION = HH (half-hourly) or HR (hourly)) and a BADM data file (e.g., 
AMF_<SITE_ID>_BIF_<VERSION>.xlsx). The BADM data file is a subset of all-site
BADM downloaded through amf_download_bif().

``` r
amf_download_base(user_id = "my_user",
                  user_email = "my_email@mail.com",
                  site_id = "US-CRT",
                  data_product = "BASE-BADM",
                  data_policy = "CCBY4.0",
                  intended_use = "remote_sensing",
                  intended_use_text = "validate the model of GPP estimation",
                  verbose = TRUE,
                  out_dir = tempdir())

```

### Download multiple-site flux/met data

The following downloads AmeriFlux flux/met data from multiple sites. 
The downloaded files are organized by sites, with one zipped file for each site.

``` r
amf_download_base(user_id = "my_user",
                  user_email = "my_email@mail.com",
                  site_id = c("US-CRT", "US-WPT", "US-Oho"),
                  data_product = "BASE-BADM",
                  data_policy = "CCBY4.0",
                  intended_use = "model",
                  intended_use_text = "Data-driven modeling, data be used for training models and cross-validation",
                  verbose = TRUE,
                  out_dir = tempdir())

```
### Additional functionalities

**Site Selection Vignette** demonstrates examples to query a list
of target sites based on sites' general information and availability
of metadata and data. 

**Data Import Vignette** demonstrates examples to import data and metadata
downloaded from AmeriFlux, and parse and clean data for further use.
