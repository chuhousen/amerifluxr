Example data and metadata files, with the same format as those downloaded from AmeriFlux (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/).

AMF_AA-Flx_BIF_20201218.xlsx
BADM data for all AmeriFlux sites that have half-hourly data. The file is a subset of original file to include only 3 sites for de mostration. The BADM file provides a description, general background, geo-location, relevant publications and references for the site. The BADM files also list what is measured at the site (this list may include chamber, gradient or other eddy covariance measurements that are a superset of the data available in AmeriFlux).

AMF_US-CRT_BASE-BADM_4-5.zip
Continuous flux/met data (i.e., AmeriFlux BASE data product) and BADM data for the US-CRT site, as an example for demonstration.
